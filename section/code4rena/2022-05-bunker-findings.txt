1. {"Vulnerability Type": "ERC1155 safeTransferFrom deviation", "Vulnerability Location": "CNft.sol#L204", "Repair Method": "Use safeBatchTransferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom with 1 item in the array", "Vulnerability Information": "The safeTransferFrom function in CNft.sol deviates from the expected behavior of the ERC1155 standard interface, which can break composability and standard behavior."}
2. {"Vulnerability Type": "Manipulation of COMP distributions", "Vulnerability Location": "Comptroller.sol", "Repair Method": "Comment all behavior associated with token distributions if token distributions are not meant to be supported, or uncomment all occurrences of the updateCompSupplyIndex() and distributeSupplierComp() functions", "Vulnerability Information": "The updateCompSupplyIndex() and distributeSupplierComp() functions in Comptroller.sol are mistakenly commented out, allowing suppliers to manipulate their yield by repeatedly supplying and removing tokens, breaking all yield distributions."}
3. {"Vulnerability Type": "Use of deprecated Chainlink API", "Vulnerability Location": "PriceOracleImplementation.sol#L29-L30", "Repair Method": "Use latestRoundData function instead of latestAnswer function", "Vulnerability Information": "The latestAnswer function in PriceOracleImplementation.sol uses a deprecated Chainlink API that may suddenly stop working, and can return stale data."}
4. {"Vulnerability Type": "Use of deprecated transfer() function", "Vulnerability Location": "CEther.sol#L167", "Repair Method": "Use call() instead of transfer(), implement CEI patterns in CEther, and add a global state lock on the comptroller", "Vulnerability Information": "The use of the deprecated transfer() function in CEther.sol can cause transactions to fail if the claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function, implements a payable fallback that uses more than 2300 gas units, or implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300."}
