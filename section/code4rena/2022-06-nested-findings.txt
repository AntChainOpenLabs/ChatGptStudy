{"Vulnerability Type": "Bypassing entryFee", "Vulnerability Location": "NestedFactory.sol#L466, ParaswapOperator.sol#L34", "Repair Method": "Charge the entry fee on the amount of output tokens after performing the swap or allow the user to only choose from a list of predefined function signatures when making calls to Paraswap", "Vulnerability Information": "Any user is able to bypass the `entryFee` collection when using `NestedFactory.create()` by passing in arbitrary calldata when using the ParaSwap router. The vulnerability also applies to other operators and can be used to bypass `exitFees`. The root cause is that `entryFee` and `exitFees` should be charged on the token that gets in and out the `Reserve`, not the inputToken/outputToken of the swap."}
