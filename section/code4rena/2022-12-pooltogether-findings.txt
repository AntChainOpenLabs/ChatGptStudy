1. {"Vulnerability Type": "User's inability to cancel L1 calls", "Vulnerability Location": "EthereumToArbitrumRelayer.sol#L118-#L127", "Repair Method": "Change `callValueRefundAddress` in `createRetryableTicket` to `_sender`", "Vulnerability Information": "An attacker can make users unable to cancel their L1 calls on Ethereum To Arbitrum."}
2. {"Vulnerability Type": "Failure to update necessary states for failing transactions", "Vulnerability Location": "EthereumToOptimismExecutor.sol#L45-L59, EthereumToArbitrumExecutor.sol#L31-L45", "Repair Method": "Store whether a relayed call was attempted to be executed to make sure the execution cannot be tried again", "Vulnerability Information": "CrossChainExecutor contracts do not update the necessary states for failing transactions."}

{"Vulnerability Type": "Loss of Excess Submission Fees", "Vulnerability Location": "CrossChainRelayerArbitrum.processCalls", "Repair Method": "Allowing the user to specify excessFeeRefundAddress and callValueRefundAddress when calling CrossChainRelayerArbitrum.processCalls", "Vulnerability Information": "When a smart contract calls CrossChainRelayerArbitrum.processCalls, excess submission fees may be lost. For EOA accounts, the excess submission fees are correctly refunded to their address on L2. However, for smart contracts, since there may not exist a corresponding address on L2, these excess submission fees will be lost. Also, since the callValueRefundAddress is also msg.sender, according to the documentation, if the Retryable Ticket is cancelled or expired, then the smart contract caller may lose all the submission fees."}
