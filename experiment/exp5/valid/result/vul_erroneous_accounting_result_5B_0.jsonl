        "yes,Price oracle manipulation.The vulnerability is in borrow and borrowToken.AMM price oracle manipulation.The CrossMarginAccount.borrow and CrossMarginAccount.borrowToken functions calculate the amount to be borrowed based on the current peg ratio. This ratio can be manipulated by flash loans, allowing an attacker to profit from the margin account funds. For example, if the current peg ratio is 1 ETH = 100 DAI, an attacker can provide a flash loan of 1 ETH for a very short period of time, and then revert the transaction. The CrossMarginAccount.borrow and CrossMarginAccount.borrowToken functions will then calculate the current peg ratio to be 1 ETH = 1 DAI, and borrow 1 ETH for 100 DAI.
