The attacker hopes that the victim doesn't have enough tokens to cover that much and the transfer() function will revert. In the revert process, the attacker can take back their original amount as well as all of the victims tokens. The function transferFrom() is similarly vulnerable, except instead of reverting transfers it calls fallback functions in approved contracts if they exist.The only way this transfer() function could be used safely is",
