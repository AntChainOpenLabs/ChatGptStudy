 Loss of vested amounts

For example an employee with a vesting stock allocation of 1000 shares vesting at each quarter over a period of 4 years, may resign after 2 years and therefore the only half of the shares would be vested and therefore sold by the employee. The employee can either sell them at each quarter, or before, or after resigning, in any case the half of the shares have vested and are by legal right owned by the employee.The VTVLContract revoke has the following defects:*   it ignores the amount already vested and now yet withdrawn*   if called, say half-way the total period, just after claimer withdraws the already vested amount, it revokes only the right to vest the remaining part in future.*   if called, say half-way the total period, right before the claimer withdraws the already vested amount, it revokes both the already vested amount and the right to vest the remaining part in future.Raising as high impact because it actually causes:*   loss of already vested amounts of a user with a valid claim that has already righteously vested a part but not withdrawn*   different outcomes depending on the order in which withdraw and revokeClaim functions are called which means that one of the two behavoiurs is certainly in conflict with the other causing a loss on one of the two sides, contract or claimer (by definition of Vesting rights, the claimer).*   lack of trust by the potential claimers/users whch can be at any time deprived of righteously vested amounts.The following two tests prove the behaviour difference when the order by which revokeClaim vs withdraw are called, whch shows that the vesting right is not guaranteed.```solidity  // NOTE: USES ORIGINAL REVOKE BEHAVIOUR  it('sample revoke use case USER LOSE: employee withdraw immediately after resignation', async () = {    const {tokenContract, vestingContract} = await createPrefundedVestingContract({tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialSupplyTokens});

   expect(await vestingContract.finalClaimableAmount(owner2.address)).to.be.equal(0);  });```Below are, in order, a test and a diff/patch for a proposed fix. The proposed fix is just an idea at how to fix, or in other words, a way to preserve the already vested amount when claim is revoked.The diff/patch add a deactivationTimestamp to claim, and a new revokeClaimProper that shall replace the revokeClaim function to correct the behaviour.The deactivationTimestamp is used to track the deactivation time for the claim in order to preserve the amount vested so far and allow the user to withdraw the amount righteously earned so far. The _baseVestedAmount and hasActiveClaim have been updated to do proper math when isActive is false but deactivationTimestamp is greater than 0.The finalVestedAmount has been update to show the ""what would be"" amount if the vesting would have reached the claim endTimestamp while the finalClaimableAmount takes into consideration the deactivationTimestamp if the claim has been revoked.The test shows that the already vested amount (cliff + half way linear vesting) is preserved.```soliditydiff --git a/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol b/contracts/VTVLVesting.solindex 133f19f..7ab955c 100644--a/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol+++ b/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol@@ -34,6 +34,7 @@ contract VTVLVesting is Context, AccessProtected {         // Gives us a range from 1 Jan 1970 (Unix epoch) up to approximately 35 thousand years from then (2^40 / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) ~= 35k)         uint40 startTimestamp; // When does the vesting start (40 bits is enough for TS)         uint40 endTimestamp; // When does the vesting end the vesting goes linearly between the start and end timestamps+        uint40 deactivationTimestamp;         uint40 cliffReleaseTimestamp; // At which timestamp is the cliffAmount released.

We did think about adding a grace withdrawing period to further strengthen the users' trust to the admin. I would argue that severity is medium in the case as in practical sense we would assume admin will inform the receivers upon revocation and therefore withdrawAdmin was designed to be separated from revokeClaim.   I acknowledge that some malicious admin might abuse this right and to claimed the receiver's already earned token before they claimed (as described in the scenario in this findings) and therefore we will consider adding the grace period to restrict admin to act maliciously.[0xean (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/475#issuecomment-1272152502):  I am going to stick with High, even a non malicious admin would have no choice but to kindly ask a user to claim before they revoked all their other tokens. If the user didn't comply, the admin has no option but to either ""steal"" their tokens or allow them to keep vesting. *","[0.0007876205490902066, -0.01888882927596569, -0.004296751227229834,

 Permanent freeze of vested tokens due to overflow in  _baseVestedAmount 

*Submitted by Trust, also found by 0xSky, bin2chen, CertoraInc, hansfriese, KIntern&#95;NA, neko&#95;nyaa, neumo, rokinot, and wastewa*[VTVLVesting.sol#L176(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L176)<brThe _baseVestedAmount() function calculates vested amount for some (claim, timestamp) pair. It is wrapped by several functions, like vestedAmount, which is used in withdraw() to calculate how much a user can retrieve from their claim. Therefore, it is critical that this function will calculate correctly for users to receive their funds.Below is the calculation of the linear vest amount:    uint112 linearVestAmount = _claim.linearVestAmount * truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs / finalVestingDurationSecs;Importantly, _claim.linearVestAmount is of type uint112 and truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs is of type uint40. Using compiler = 0.8.0,  the product cannot exceed uint112 or else the function reverts due to overflow. In fact, we can show that uint112 is an inadequate size for this calculation.The max value for uint112 is 5192296858534827628530496329220096.<brSeconds in year = 3600 &ast; 24 &ast; 365 = 31536000<brTokens that inherit from ERC20 like the ones used in VTVL have 18 decimal places - 1000000000000000000<brThis means the maximum number of tokens that are safe to vest for one year is 2&ast;&ast;112 / 10e18 / (3600 &ast; 24 &ast; 365) = just 16,464,665 tokens.This is definitely not a very large amount and it is expected that some projects will mint a similar or larger amount for vesting for founders / early employees. For 4 year vesting, the safe amount drops to 4,116,166.<brProjects that are not forewarned about this size limit are likely to suffer from freeze of funds of employees, which will require very patchy manual revocation and restructuring of the vesting to not overflow.Employees/founders do not have access to their vested tokens.Below is a test that demonstrates the overflow issue, 1 year after 17,000,000 tokens have matured.    describe('Long vest fail', async () = {      let vestingContract: VestingContractType;      // Default params      // linearly Vest 10000, every 1s, between TS 1000

  });Manual audit, hardhat / chai.Perform the intermediate calculation of linearVestAmount using the uint256 type.    uint112 linearVestAmount = uint112( uint256(_claim.linearVestAmount) *

Else require that the minted amount is not larger than mintable supply.One can note that it is possible to mint all mintable supply. Then the mintable supply will be `0` which will be interpreted as infinity and any number of tokens will be possible to be minted.Treat `2  256 1` as infinity instead of `0`.[0xean (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/3#issuecomment-1256802394):  The warden's logic is correct, but given that this is behind an admin only flag, there are some external factors that would need to come into play for this to be realized.

[VTVLVesting.sol#L183-L187(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L183-L187)<br[VTVLVesting.sol#L198(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L198)<brAs the comments in `_baseVestedAmount()` explain, once there is any `_claim.amountWithdrawn`, it will be returned if it is greater than the calculated value `vestAmt`. However, `vestAmt` takes account of time, `_referenceTs`, whereas `_claim.amountWithdrawn` is always the amount withdrawn to date. Therefore, for all historical values below `_claim.amountWithdrawn`, including timestamps before `_claim.startTimestamp` and before `_claim.cliffReleaseTimestamp`, `_claim.amountWithdrawn` will be returned.Given that VTVL is intended to be an accessible platform for use by a wide variety of users, this behaviour does create a security risk. Consider these scenarios:*   A protocol relies on VTVL as an off-the-shelf solution for vesting, but builds other systems (escrow, NFT grants, access, airdrops) that work by checking the value of `vestedAmount()`. Airdrops are especially likely to be interested in historical values. These values would be distorted by how much users have claimed and so would result in an undesirable distribution of resources.*   Even if the above does not occur, consider that VTVL might be passed over as a vesting solution precisely because its historical data is inaccurate.*   A contract could be built that inherits from `VTVLVesting` and attempts to use `_baseVestedAmount()` (which is `internal` and so can be used by inheriting contracts). The inheriting contract might apportion rewards based on historical usage.*   VTVL itself might wish to inherit from `VTVLVesting` in future.```diffdiff --git a/test/VTVLVesting.ts b/test/VTVLVestingPOC.tsindex bb609fb..073e53f 100644--a/test/VTVLVesting.ts+++ b/test/VTVLVestingPOC.ts@@ -500,14 +500,37 @@ describe('Revoke Claim', async () = {   const recipientAddress = await randomAddress();   const owner, owner2] = await ethers.getSigners();  it('allows admin to revoke a valid claim', async () = {+  it('POC: WITHDRAWN DATA IS UNRELIABLE', async () = {     const {vestingContract} = await createPrefundedVestingContract({tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialSupplyTokens});   await vestingContract.createClaim(recipientAddress, startTimestamp, endTimestamp, cliffReleaseTimestamp, releaseIntervalSecs, linearVestAmount, cliffAmount);+    const startTimestamp2 = startTimestamp.add(releaseIntervalSecs.mul(100));+    const endTimestamp2 = endTimestamp.add(releaseIntervalSecs.mul(100));+    const cliffReleaseTimestamp2 = cliffReleaseTimestamp.add(releaseIntervalSecs.mul(100));+    await vestingContract.createClaim(owner2.address, startTimestamp2, endTimestamp2, cliffReleaseTimestamp2, releaseIntervalSecs, linearVestAmount, cliffAmount);++    // Fast forward to middle of claim+    const halfWay = startTimestamp2.toNumber() + (endTimestamp2.toNumber()-startTimestamp2.toNumber())/2;+    await ethers.provider.send(""evm_mine"", halfWay]);++    let vestAmt = await vestingContract.vestedAmount(owner2.address, startTimestamp);+    console.log(""NO WITHDRAWAL, BEFORE VEST START: "",vestAmt.toString());+    vestAmt = await vestingContract.vestedAmount(owner2.address, startTimestamp2);+    console.log(""NO WITHDRAWAL, AT VEST START: "",vestAmt.toString());+    vestAmt = await vestingContract.vestedAmount(owner2.address, halfWay);+    console.log(""NO WITHDRAWAL, HALF WAY THROUGH VEST: "",vestAmt.toString());+    vestAmt = await vestingContract.vestedAmount(owner2.address, endTimestamp2);+    console.log(""NO WITHDRAWAL, AT VEST END: "",vestAmt.toString());++    await (await vestingContract.connect(owner2).withdraw()).wait();    (await vestingContract.revokeClaim(recipientAddress)).wait();+    vestAmt = await vestingContract.vestedAmount(owner2.address, startTimestamp);+    console.log(""WITHDRAWAL, BEFORE VEST START: "",vestAmt.toString());+    vestAmt = await vestingContract.vestedAmount(owner2.address, startTimestamp2);+    console.log(""WITHDRAWAL, AT VEST START: "",vestAmt.toString());+    vestAmt = await vestingContract.vestedAmount(owner2.address, halfWay);+    console.log(""WITHDRAWAL, HALF WAY THROUGH VEST: "",vestAmt.toString());+    vestAmt = await vestingContract.vestedAmount(owner2.address, endTimestamp2);+    console.log(""WITHDRAWAL, AT VEST END: "",vestAmt.toString());    // Make sure it gets reverted   expect(await (await vestingContract.getClaim(recipientAddress)).isActive).to.be.equal(false);   });    it('prohibits a random user from revoking a valid claim', async () = {```For active claims, there is no reason to consider `_claim.amountWithdrawn`, as it will always have been below or equal to `vestAmt` at any point in time.

 Possible DoS on  vestingRecipients  due to lack of disposal mechanism

This would make the variable not grow without reducing elements.[0xean (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/128#issuecomment-1257069235):  On the fence on this one.  I agree with the warden, but in the current implementation `allVestingRecipients` is unused and assumed to be for external, off chain uses so the impact is hard to determine. Going to leave as Medium, pending sponsor review.[lawrencehui (VTVL) confirmed and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/128#issuecomment-1270859394):  I would agree with the warden on the lack of control for an ever-growing array size could be an issue. I will tag this as an enhancement.   On the side, I want to check what is the allowed max size of the array in this case? `2256 -1`? but theoretically calling a large array would exceed the the block gas limit when retrieving it?[0xean (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/128#issuecomment-1272143412):  @lawrencehui Yes retrieval will eventually fail, long before you populate the array fully. You could pass in an index range to retrieve portions of the array to avoid this failure mode.  And yes `2256 -1` is my understanding of the theoretical limit. *","[0.0002924651198554784, -0.008508720435202122, 0.0021307223942130804, -0.029670707881450653, -0.03054920956492424,

While true, why wouldn't the employee just use a different address?  There is no residual benefit to using the old address (unless it was a smart contract, which the warden doesn't mention as part of their POC).  The sponsor may want to fix this, since the fix is simple, but it poses very little risk and certainly no direct loss of funds. [0xean (judge) increased severity to Medium and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/140#issuecomment-1257197630):  Spent a bit more time thinking about this one and do think that it qualifies as Medium severity since it does affect the availability of the protocol in a number of ways. Going to go ahead and revise to Medium. [lawrencehui (VTVL) acknowledged, but disagreed with severity and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/140#issuecomment-1270868222):  The vesting contract is designed to be created and used in a one-off manner and the revoke function is to prevent any mistakes made upon creation (wrong address / amount / timestamp etc.). In practical sense, if a claim (or the recipient address) is revoked, one (the admin) can always create a new vesting contract with the correct claim parameters.   I therefore think that it is by design that the address is only able be claimable once per vesting contract, in all circumstance, the admin can re-create a new vesting contract to mitigate this issue and therefore this is a low risk / non-critical issue. [0xean (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/140#issuecomment-1272144853):  I don't think the tactic of deploying a new contract is the correct one here simply to be able to set up vesting for one botched person or someone whose vesting token amount changes for example. I am going to stick with the Medium severity on this one, but do appreciate the response and thoughts on possible mitigations.[ak1 (warden) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/140#issuecomment-1279883877):  I have explained one of the real use case scenarios where this protocol will fail to serve many. Refer to issue 384(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/384).<br It is not always contract address or EOA which will decide the identity of a person. Each one will have unique ID. That id is going to be used in all the places.*","[0.0149295749142766, -0.010359296575188637, -0.020247716456651688, -0.03958137705922127, -0.009881495498120785, 0.026313722133636475,

 Tokens with lower number of decimals can result in postponed linear vesting for user

[VTVLVesting.sol#L174(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/69da6e96f94ff3e02b9bb6175e6de2b3e71d3eb0/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L174)<brIn the `_baseVestedAmount` of `VTVLVesting.sol` we see the following code```solidityuint40 finalVestingDurationSecs = _claim.endTimestamp _claim.startTimestamp; // length of the intervaluint112 linearVestAmount = _claim.linearVestAmount * truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs / finalVestingDurationSecs;```Let’s look at `truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs` as just the duration passed from the start of the vesting period for the PoC (this doesn’t omit important data in this context).Now think of the following scenario:We have a token `$TKN` that has 6 decimals (those are the decimals of both USDT & USDC). We want to distribute 10,000 of those tokens to a user vested over a 10 year period.10 years in seconds is 315360000 &ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;(this is `finalVestingDurationSecs`)This means that we will distribute 10,000 &ast; 10^6 = 10 000 000 000 fractions of a token for 315360000 seconds, meaning we will distribute 310 fractions of a token each second this is `linearVestAmount`Now, since `finalVestingDurationSecs` is so big (315360000) it will almost always round `linearVestAmount` to zero when dividing by it, up until`_claim.linearVestAmount * truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs` becomes a bigger number than 315360000, but since `_claim.linearVestAmount` is 310 we will need the current vesting duration to be at least 1 017 290 seconds which is 12 days postponed vesting. 12 days in a moving market can make a big difference if the user was expecting the tokens to start vesting from the first day.Unexpected postponing of vesting can result in waiting times for users to receive their must-be-vested tokens. This period can be used by other token holders to dump the token and decrease the price of it, resulting in a loss of capital for the vesting receiver.Enforce the contract to work with only 18 decimal tokens with a `require` statement in the constructor.[0xean (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/191#issuecomment-1257051653):  Downgrading to Medium, there are a lot of external factors presented here by the warden to line up to a loss of funds.  [lawrencehui (VTVL) acknowledged, but disagreed with severity and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/191#issuecomment-1270955314):  I acknowledge the warden's concern of the rounding, but I think the result of loss of funds is one of the extreme edge cases. I would suggest instead of restricting only to 18 decimal tokens (which is impractical as we would also want to include USDC and USDT for vesting too!), I would implement the rounding checking in the frontend UI and prompt user of potential delay caused by rounding / truncation as described in this issue.[0xean (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/191#issuecomment-1272146188):  Given that smart contracts can be interacted with in any number of ways (etherscan, programmatically, etc), I don't think the mitigation negates the risk entirely and am going to stick with the Medium severity here.  The wardens demonstrates clearly the way in which this can happen. While it may be a bit outside of the normal vesting schedule expected, I do think it's valuable to understand the bounds of the math you have employed here.*","[0.0036949010100215673,

 Variable balance token causing fund lock and loss

The balance could become insufficient at the time of `withdraw()`. User's fund will be locked due to DoS. The way to take the fund out is to send more token into the contract, causing fund loss to the protocol. And there is no guarantee that until the end time the balance would stay above the needed amount, the lock and loss issue persist.For stETH like tokens, the `balanceOf()` value might go up or down, even without transfer.```solidity// stETH    function balanceOf(address who) external override view returns (uint256) {        return _shareBalances[who].div(_sharesPerToken);    }```In `VTVLVesting`, the `require` check for the spot `balanceOf()` value will pass, but it is possible that as time goes on, the value become smaller and fail the transfer. As a result, the `withdraw()` call will revert, causing DoS, and lock user's fund.```solidity// contracts/VTVLVesting.sol    function _createClaimUnchecked() private  hasNoClaim(_recipient) {        // ...        require(tokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this)) = numTokensReservedForVesting + allocatedAmount, ""INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE"");        // ...    }    function withdraw() hasActiveClaim(_msgSender()) external {        // ...        tokenAddress.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), amountRemaining);        // ...    }```<https://etherscan.io/address/0x312ca0592a39a5fa5c87bb4f1da7b77544a91b87#codeDisallow such kind of variable balance token.[0xean (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/278#issuecomment-1257053341):  stETH only rebases up, not down.  So that is a poor example.  The sponsor's README does say they will support any ERC20 token, so that could include Fee on Transfer or downward rebasing tokens which could lead to less tokens in the contract than expected and transfers to revert due to balances being lower than expected.   Downgrading to Medium as the external requirement is using these contracts on tokens that are known to have variable supply.[lawrencehui (VTVL) confirmed and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/278#issuecomment-1270993220):  Thanks for reporting this and I will add this as a feature enhancement to cater / avoid for tokens with rebasing supplies.   Question: Is there a straight forward way to detect rebasing tokens? Or on the flip side, restricting erc20 tokens that do not exhibit rebasing behaviour?[0xean (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/278#issuecomment-1272148124):  @lawrencehui Great question.  There isn't a great way to detect this functionality in any generic manner unfortunately.   Most contracts that want to handle FOT tokens will do something like (in pseudocode)  ``` uint256 balBefore = ERC20.balanceOf(address(this)); ERC20.transferFrom(...); uint256 balAfter= ERC20.balanceOf(address(this)); uint256 actualBalChange = balAfter balBefore; ```  Rebasing tokens are different again, and the easiest way to handle them is to create shares to track the internal math.  The shares track the % ownership of the entire balance of the contract.  Probably more than I can explain here, but would be happy to work with you if this is something you are interested in.*","[0.0004745519836433232, -0.013374529778957367, -0.014015392400324345,

 Vesting Schedule Start and End Time can be Set in the Past 

[VTVLVesting.sol#L245-L304(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L245-L304)<brThere is no check whether `_startTimestamp` and `_endTimestamp` is greater than `block.timestamp`at `VTVLVesting.sol` `_createClaimUnchecked` function. Therefore it is possible for administrators to accidentally createvesting schedule that starts and ends in the past without noticing it. When administrators does this and this transaction goesthrough, then the vesting recipients can withdraw their entire vest amount which is not what administrators intended to do.Add require check that force `_startTimestamp` to be greater than `block.timestamp`.Team comments as below on line 260    // - Conclusion: we want to allow this, for founders that might have forgotten to add some users, or to avoid issues with     transactions not going through because of discoordination between block.timestamp and sender's local timeHowever this is not an issue by adding `require(_startTimestamp  uint40(block.timestamp))` since this will reverttransaction if _startTimestamp is less than block.timestamp so administrators can simply try again with correct time.On the other hand, it is more dangerous to not include this check because transaction will simply succeed even though_startTimestamp is set to past which means that there is a chance of administrators not noticing this.1. Admin creates new vesting schedule using `createClaim` function. However admin mistakenly set `_startTimestamp` and `_endTimestamp` in the past.2. Since there is no check of `require(_startTimestamp  uint40(block.timestamp))`, this transaction is valid and claimis created.3. Vesting recipients calls the `withdraw` function and receive entire vest amount.Add following check in `VTVLVesting.sol:_createClaimUnchecked` function.    require(_startTimestamp  uint40(block.timestamp), ""INVALID_START_TIMESTAMP"")[0xean (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/292#issuecomment-1257257193):  Going to use this issue for encompassing a few different reports that all revolve around adding some better validation around timestamps.  These include a few different potential fixes that the sponsor can review, but ultimately point to the same underlying issues.[lawrencehui (VTVL) acknowledged, but disagreed with severity and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/292#issuecomment-1270998197):  As described in the documentation, this back dated (`startTimestamp < block.timestamp`) feature is indeed intended as there are many real life cases that founders want to reward their employees in the way the vesting period starts well before Token Generation Event (TGE).   We appreciate wardens' feedback on additional checking (both start and end time) and in our actual application, we would include multiple layer of checking / approval processes in front and backend before the transaction signing happens and therefore the risk is low in our opinion. *","[2.386745654803235e-05, -0.029272625222802162, -0.027698978781700134, -0.046513114124536514,

 Two address tokens can be withdrawn by the admin even if they are vested

[VTVLVesting.sol#L446-L451(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L446-L451)<brTwo address tokens exist in the blockchain. For example, Synthetix's `ProxyERC20` contract is such a token which exists in many forms (sUSD, sBTC...). Tokens as such can be vested, but the admin can withdraw them even if they are vested by providing the other address to the `withdrawOtherToken` function. The only check in this function is that `_otherTokenAddress != tokenAddress`, which is irrelevant in the case of two address tokens.This can make the admin be able to withdraw the vested funds and break the system, because the balance of the contract can be less than the vested amount.1.  The `VTVLVesting` is deployed with the `sUSD` contract, using its main (proxy) address `0x57Ab1ec28D129707052df4dF418D58a2D46d5f51`.2.  A claim is created for Alice, vesting 1000 sUSD in linear vesting. Assuming this is the only claim currently, the balance of the contract is 1000 sUSD and the value of `numTokensReservedForVesting` is `1000e18`.3.  The admin calls the `withdrawOtherToken` for 1000e18 sUSD, providing its second address `0x57Ab1ec28D129707052df4dF418D58a2D46d5f51`. The value of `numTokensReservedForVesting` is still `1000e18`, but the balance of the contract is now 0 sUSD.4.  Alice waits for her vest to end, calls the withdraw function, but the function reverts on the call to `safeTransfer()` because there is insufficient balance of sUSD. Alice can't receive her funds.Replace the address check with a balance check record the vesting token balance of the contract before and after the transfer and assert that they are equal.[0xean (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/429#issuecomment-1257055160):  Downgrading to Medium. The fix is a good idea, but this is a pretty rare token implementation and definitely qualifies as an external factor. [lawrencehui (VTVL) acknowledged and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/429#issuecomment-1271301629):  Yes, agreed with @0xean that this is very rare and appreciate warden's suggestion on the fix on balance checking.*","[0.006059182807803154, -0.013866751454770565, -0.011665343306958675, -0.019423361867666245, -0.016393771395087242, 0.04309381544589996,

  _releaseIntervalSecs  is not validated

VTVLVesting.sol has `_createClaimUnchecked` function to create the claims internally while validating parameters with the users' allocations.<brHowever, `_releaseIntervalSecs` is not validated comparing to user's  `_linearVestAmount` and `_startTimestamp` `_endTimestamp`.Theoretically, `_linearVestAmount` should be equal to `((_endTimestamp _startTimestamp) * _releaseIntervalSecs)` so the `_releaseIntervalSecs` = `_linearVestAmount / ((_endTimestamp _startTimestamp)`.<brBut this check was never done.If the `_releaseIntervalSecs` is validated either to a higher or to a lower amount, it will create unfair distributions amongst the users during withdrawals due to being higher/lower than it should be. And also it may end up with the last withdrawals can be reverted due to the calculation board not matching.```solidity    function _createClaimUnchecked(            address _recipient,             uint40 _startTimestamp,             uint40 _endTimestamp,             uint40 _cliffReleaseTimestamp,             uint40 _releaseIntervalSecs,             uint112 _linearVestAmount,             uint112 _cliffAmount                ) private  hasNoClaim(_recipient) {        require(_recipient != address(0), ""INVALID_ADDRESS"");        require(_linearVestAmount + _cliffAmount  0, ""INVALID_VESTED_AMOUNT""); // Actually only one of linearvested/cliff amount must be 0, not necessarily both        require(_startTimestamp  0, ""INVALID_START_TIMESTAMP"");        // Do we need to check whether _startTimestamp is greater than the current block.timestamp?         // Or do we allow schedules that started in the past?         // - Conclusion: we want to allow this, for founders that might have forgotten to add some users, or to avoid issues with transactions not going through because of discoordination between block.timestamp and sender's local time        // require(_endTimestamp  0, ""_endTimestamp must be valid""); // not necessary because of the next condition (transitively)        require(_startTimestamp < _endTimestamp, ""INVALID_END_TIMESTAMP""); // _endTimestamp must be after _startTimestamp        require(_releaseIntervalSecs  0, ""INVALID_RELEASE_INTERVAL"");        require((_endTimestamp _startTimestamp) % _releaseIntervalSecs == 0, ""INVALID_INTERVAL_LENGTH"");        // Potential TODO: sanity check, if _linearVestAmount == 0, should we perhaps force that start and end ts are the same?        // No point in allowing cliff TS without the cliff amount or vice versa.        // Both or neither of _cliffReleaseTimestamp and _cliffAmount must be set.

 Reentrancy may allow an admin to steal funds

*Submitted by Czar102, also found by 0xSmartContract, csanuragjain, hansfriese, Lambda, Respx, and sashik&#95;eth*[VTVLVesting.sol#L394-L411(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/main/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L394-L411)<brIf the token is reentrant, an admin can steal all tokens locked in the `VTVLVesting` contract while having active locks.In other words, due to this exploit possibility, the contract may be insolvent with respect to *active* vestings. Note that revoking claim doesn't break this invariant since the vesting is closed in that case.The reentrancy in the vested token can be used by an admin if the execution can be hijacked before the balance change occurs.```js/@notice Admin withdrawal of the unallocated tokens.@param _amountRequested the amount that we want to withdraw	*/function withdrawAdmin(uint112 _amountRequested) public onlyAdmin {    	// Allow the owner to withdraw any balance not currently tied up in contracts.	uint256 amountRemaining = tokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this)) numTokensReservedForVesting;	require(amountRemaining = _amountRequested, ""INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE"");	// Actually withdraw the tokens	// Reentrancy note this operation doesn't touch any of the internal vars, simply transfers	// Also following Checks-effects-interactions pattern	tokenAddress.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _amountRequested);	// Let the withdrawal known to everyone	emit AdminWithdrawn(_msgSender(), _amountRequested);}```Let's consider function `withdrawAdmin`. Firstly, the balance is checked and then if there is enough token surplus to withdraw, the withdrawal is allowed. The surplus is based on two values: `numTokensReservedForVesting` which isn't changed by this function and the balance of the contract.If the owner hijacks the execution before the balance change in the token transfer (which is possible in, for example, ERC777), an admin can call this function again and it will allow for an invocation of another transfer since the token balance hasn't changed yet.For example, if there is `$1m` in vestings in the contract, an admin can send `$100k` to it in tokens and recursively invoke `withdrawalAdmin` with the amount of `$100k` eleven times so that the whole contract balance will be drained.Add `ReentrancyGuard`'s `nonReentrant` to the `withdrawAdmin` function.[0xean (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/6#issuecomment-1257063808):  This would require a number of assumptions to be the case including a malicious admin which the sponsors called out of scope.  Because it is obviously not intended functionality, I am going to leave as Medium pending sponsor review. I think the non-reentrant modifier is worth adding. [lawrencehui (VTVL) acknowledged and commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/6#issuecomment-1271726987):  Will consider adding ReentrancyGuard as
