{"Vulnerability Type": "Loss of Funds", "Vulnerability Location": "TribeRedeemer contract", "Repair Method": "Inherit the Pausable contract and allow users to redeem when a sufficient number of tokens have been sent to the contract", "Vulnerability Information": "A malicious user can send tokens to the TribeRedeemer contract to make the redeem function work, and other users may lose assets as a result."}

{"Vulnerability Type": "Incorrect Calculation", "Vulnerability Location": "TribeRedeemer.sol#L58, TribeRedeemer.sol#L70", "Repair Method": "Use IERC20(_redeemedToken).totalSupply() instead of redeemBase for calculating the amount of tokens left for redeeming", "Vulnerability Information": "If someone transfers tokens directly to the TribeRedeemer contract, the redeemBase value will not be decreased, and the exchange ratio will not be correct, resulting in users receiving less than they should. Additionally, tokens sent directly to the contract are effectively burned and not used in the accounting of redemptions or redeemBase."}
