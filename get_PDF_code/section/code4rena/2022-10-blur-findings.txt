1. {"Vulnerability Type": "Contract Owner Possesses Too Many Privileges", "Vulnerability Location": "ExecutionDelegate.sol#L119", "Repair Method": "Reconsider the protocol's design. BlurExchange.sol should be approved by users instead. The exchange should require that the buyer has received their NFT and the seller has received their ETH/WETH or revert.", "Vulnerability Information": "The owner can set `approvedContract`  to any address at any time with `approveContract(address _contract)`, and `revokeApproval()` can be frontrun. As a result, all user funds approved to the `ExecutionDelegate` contract can be lost via rugpull."}
2. {"Vulnerability Type": "StandardPolicyERC1155 returns amount == 1 instead of amount == order.amount", "Vulnerability Location": "StandardPolicyERC1155.sol#L12-L36", "Repair Method": "Policies used for ERC1155 tokens should return and consider the amount of tokens set for the order.", "Vulnerability Information": "The `canMatchMakerAsk` and `canMatchMakerBid` functions in `StandardPolicyERC1155.sol` will only return 1 as the amount instead of the order.amount value. This value is then used in the `_executeTokenTransfer` call during the execution flow and leads to only 1 ERC1155 token being sent."}
