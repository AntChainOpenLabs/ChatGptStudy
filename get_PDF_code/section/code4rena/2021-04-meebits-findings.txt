1. {"Vulnerability Type": "Signature malleability", "Vulnerability Location": "EVM's ecrecover in verify()", "Repair Method": "Use OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library", "Vulnerability Information": "EVM's ecrecover is susceptible to signature malleability, which allows replay attacks."}
2. {"Vulnerability Type": "Arbitrary Transfer of Unowned NFTs", "Vulnerability Location": "tradeValid function invoked by acceptTrade", "Repair Method": "Add an additional check within verify that ensures the signer is not the zero-address", "Vulnerability Information": "It is possible to arbitrarily transfer any NFT that is not owned by any address."}
3. {"Vulnerability Type": "Predictable minting of a specific token ID", "Vulnerability Location": "randomIndex", "Repair Method": "Recommend not generating random IDs and instead using counters", "Vulnerability Information": "`randomIndex' is not random."}
4. {"Vulnerability Type": "TradeValid() erroneously returning true", "Vulnerability Location": "Beebots.TradeValid()", "Repair Method": "Add a check to Beebots.verify() and Beebots.tradeValid()", "Vulnerability Information": "Beebots.TradeValid() will erroneously return true when maker is set to address(0) and makerIds are set to the tokenIds of unminted beebot NFTs."}
5. {"Vulnerability Type": "ERC-721 Enumerable Spec mismatch", "Vulnerability Location": "tokenByIndex function", "Repair Method": "Accept 0 index by changing to require(index = 0 && index < TOKEN_LIMIT)", "Vulnerability Information": "Index starts at 0 for token array, but the implementation here requires index to be greater than 0."}
6. {"Vulnerability Type": "NFT can be minted for free after sale ended", "Vulnerability Location": "getPrice() function", "Repair Method": "If it's unexpected behavior, it is recommended to revert instead of returning 0", "Vulnerability Information": "The getPrice() function returned 0 after the sale ended and NFT can be minted for free."}
7. {"Vulnerability Type": "TokenByIndex treats last index as invalid", "Vulnerability Location": "tokenByIndex function", "Repair Method": "Change require(index > 0 && index < TOKEN_LIMIT) to require(index > 0 && index <= TOKEN_LIMIT)", "Vulnerability Information": "Function tokenByIndex treats last index as invalid."}
8. {"Vulnerability Type": "Legacy Function Usage", "Vulnerability Location": "withdraw function", "Repair Method": "Use a safe wrapper library, such as the OpenZeppelin Address library's sendValue function", "Vulnerability Information": "The withdraw function utilizes the transfer invocation, which has a fixed gas stipend and can fail."}
9. {"Vulnerability Type": "Using transfer() to withdraw ether", "Vulnerability Location": "withdraw function", "Repair Method": "Use call() to send ETH", "Vulnerability Information": "To withdraw ETH, it uses transfer(), this transaction will fail inevitably in certain cases."}
