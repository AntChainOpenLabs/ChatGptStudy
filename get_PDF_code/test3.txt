Risk descriptions and fix results explained

[OneBoxToken-1 Medium] The implementation of minting related functions is inconsistent
with the demand

> Description: As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the contract implements two mint functions for the contract
owner to mint tokens. The mint function in the parent contract BEP20 (Figure 1) checked the cap of
minting, but did not call the _moveDelegates function to update the voting information of the
corresponding address; while the mint function in the main contract OneBoxToken (Figure 2) called the
_moveDelegates function to update the voting information of the corresponding address, but the cap of

minting has not been checked.

mint to, _ amount onlyOwner
_mint(_to, _amount);
_moveDelegates( a), _delegates[_to], _amount);

Figure 2 Source code of mint function in OneBoxToken contract (unfixed)

> Fix recommendations: Delete the mint function in the parent contract BEP20; rewrite the _mint function
in the main contract OneBoxToken, and add the logic of checking the cap of minting.

> Fix results: Fixed. In the new version of the contract, two mint functions have been merged into one, the
_mint function is rewritten in the main contract, and the _moveDelegates function is called internally to
transfer voting information.

_mint( account, amount)
. mint(account, amount);

_moveDelegates( (8), _delegates[account], amount);

[OneBoxToken-2 Medium] The voting information is not updated synchronously when the

token is transferred

> Description: This contract implements the transfer and fransferFrom functions for users to transfer
tokens. But the transfer logic processing function _fransfer function does not transfer the vote of the

corresponding address.

e(recipient !=

_balances[sender] = _balances[sender].sub (amount,
_balances[recipient] = _balances[recipient] .add(amount);
Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);

Figure 4 Source code of _transfer function in BEP2O contract

> Fix recommendations: Rewrite the _fransfer function in the main contract OneBoxToken, and call
_moveDelegates internally to transfer voting information.
> Fix results: Fixed. In the new version of the contract, the _fransfer function has been rewritten in the

main contract, and the _moveDelegates function is called internally to transfer voting information.

_transfer(

. transfer (sender ,‚recipient, amount);

_moveDelegates(_delegates[sender], _delegates[recipient], amount);

[OneBoxToken-3 Info] Compiler warning

> Description: This contract specifies that the compiler version is 0.6.12, and the compiler warning shown

in Figure 6 appears when the contract is compiled with this version of the compiler.


> Fix recommendations: Follow the compiler warning, modify the code, and eliminate the

warning.

> Fixresults: Fixed.

Table 2 - 1BOX Token Information

2. Token distribution instructions

For the tokens of this contract, 300 million tokens will be allocated to the deployer when the contract
is deployed. After the contract is deployed, the contract owner can manage the minting authority, and
the address with the mint authority can call the mint function of the contract to mint the token to the
specified address. The cap of tokens is 1 billion.

3. Voting mechanism

In this contract, the user can call the delegate function to delegate voting to the specified address (or
use the delegateBySig function to delegate based on the signature data), and the voting information

will be updated simultaneously when the token transfer is made by the delegated user.

3 Business Security
Business Implementations

1. Coding Conventions
1.1. Compiler Version Security

The old version of the compiler may cause various known security issues. Developers are advised to
specify the contract code to use the latest compiler version and eliminate the compiler alerts.
1.2. Deprecated Items

The Solidity smart contract development language is in rapid iteration. Some keywords have been
deprecated by newer versions of the compiler, such as throw, years, etc. To eliminate the potential pitfalls they
may cause, contract developers should not use the keywords that have been deprecated by the current

compiler version.

1.3. Redundant Code
Redundant code in smart contracts can reduce code readability and may require more gas consumption
for contract deployment. It is recommended to eliminate redundant code.
1.4. SafeMath Features
Check whether the functions within the SafeMath library are correctly used in the contract to perform
mathematical operations, or perform other overflow prevention checks.
1.5. require/assert Usage
Solidity uses state recovery exceptions to handle errors. This mechanism will undo all changes made to
the state in the current call (and all its subcalls) and flag the errors to the caller. The functions assert and
require can be used to check conditions and throw exceptions when the conditions are not met. The assert
function can only be used to test for internal errors and check non-variables. The require function is used to
confirm the validity of conditions, such as whether the input variables or contract state variables meet the
conditions, or to verify the return value of external contract calls.
1.6. Gas Consumption
The smart contract virtual machine needs gas to execute the contract code. When the gas is insufficient,
the code execution will throw an out of gas exception and cancel all state changes. Contract developers are
required to control the gas consumption of the code to avoid function execution failures due to insufficient gas.
1.7. Visibility Specifiers
Check whether the visibility conforms to design requirement.
1.8. Fallback Usage
Check whether the Fallback function has been used correctly in the current contract.
2. General Vulnerability
2.1. Integer overflow
Integer overflow is a security problem in many languages, and they are especially dangerous in smart
contracts. Solidity can handle up to 256-bit numbers (2**256-1). If the maximum number is increased by 1, it
will overflow to 0. Similarly, when the number is a uint type, O0 minus 1 will underflow to get the maximum
number value. Overflow conditions can lead to incorrect results, especially if its possible results are not
expected, which may affect the reliability and safety of the program. For the compiler version after Solidity
0.8.0, smart contracts will perform overflow checking on mathematical operations by default. In the previous
compiler versions, developers need to add their own overflow checking code, and SafeMath library is
recommended to use.
2.2. Reentrancy
The reentrancy vulnerability is the most typical Binance Smart Chain smart contract vulnerability, which
has caused the DAO to be attacked. The risk of reentry attack exists when there is an error in the logical order
of calling the call.value() function to send assets.

2.3 Pseudo-random Number Generator (PRNG)


BEOSIN
Beosin, Blockchain Security

Random numbers may be used in smart contracts. In solidity, it is common to use block information as a
random factor to generate, but such use is insecure. Block information can be controlled by miners or obtained
by attackers during transactions, and such random numbers are to some extent predictable or collidable.

2.4. Transaction-Ordering Dependence

In the process of transaction packing and execution, when faced with transactions of the same difficulty,
miners tend to choose the one with higher gas cost to be packed first, so users can specify a higher gas cost to
have their transactions packed and executed first.

2.5. DoS(Denial of Service)

DoS, or Denial of Service, can prevent the target from providing normal services. Due to the
immutability of smart contracts, this type of attack can make it impossible to ever restore the contract to its
normal working state. There are various reasons for the denial of service of a smart contract, including
malicious revert when acting as the recipient of a transaction, gas exhaustion caused by code design flaws, etc.
2.6. Function Call Permissions

If smart contracts have high-privilege functions, such as coin minting, self-destruction, change owner,
etc., permission restrictions on function calls are required to avoid security problems caused by permission
leakage.

2.7. call/delegatecall Security

Solidity provides the call/delegatecall function for function calls, which can cause call injection
vulnerability if not used properly. For example, the parameters of the call, if controllable, can control this
contract to perform unauthorized operations or call dangerous functions of other contracts.

2.8. Returned Value Security

In Solidity, there are transfer(), send(), call.value() and other methods. The transaction will be rolled back
if the transfer fails, while send and call.value will return false if the transfer fails. If the return is not correctly
judged, the unanticipated logice may be executed. In addition, in the implementation of the
transfer/transferFrom function of the token contract, it is also necessary to avoid the transfer failure and return
false, so as not to create fake recharge loopholes.

2.9. tx.origin Usage

The tx.origin represents the address of the initial creator of the transaction. If tx.origin is used for
permission judgment, errors may occur; in addition, if the contract needs to determine whether the caller is the
contract address, then tx.origin should be used instead of extcodesize.

2.10. Replay Attack

A replay attack means that if two contracts use the same code implementation, and the identity
authentication is in the transmission of parameters, the transaction information can be replayed to the other
contract to execute the transaction when the user executes a transaction to one contract.

2.11. Overriding Variables


BEOSIN
Beosin, Blockchain Security

There are complex variable types in Solidity, such as structures, dynamic arrays, etc. When using a lower
version of the compiler, improperly assigning values to it may result in overwriting the values of existing state

variables, causing logical exceptions during contract execution.
