                "Description": "The function safeTransferFrom is a standard interface in ERC1155, and its expected to succeed if all the parameters are valid, and revert on error, which is not the case here so its a deviation.",
                "Repair": "Call function safeBatchTransferFrom instead of revert"

                "Description": "The updateCompSupplyIndex() and distributeSupplierComp() functions are used by Compound to track distributions owed to users for supplying funds to the protocol. Bunker protocol is a fork of compound with NFT integration, however, part of the original functionality appears to have been mistakenly commented out.",
                "Repair": "Comment all behaviour associated with token distributions if token distributions are not meant to be supported. Otherwise, it is worthwhile uncommenting all occurrences of the updateCompSupplyIndex() and distributeSupplierComp() functions."

                "Description": "According to Chainlink's documentation, the latestAnswer function is deprecated.",
                "Repair": "Use the latestRoundData function to get the price instead. Add checks on the return data with proper revert messages if the price is stale or the round is uncomplete"

                "Repair": "Use call() instead of transfer(), but be sure to implement CEI patterns in CEther and add a global state lock on the comptroller"
