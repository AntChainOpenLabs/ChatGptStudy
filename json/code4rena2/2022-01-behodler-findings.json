A MicroDAO manages parameterization of running dapps without having\n *control over existential functionality. This is not to say that some of the decisions taken are not critical but that the domain\n *of influence is confined to the local Dapp - Limbo in this case.\n * LimboDAO has two forms of decision making: proposals and flash governance. For proposals, voting power is required. Voting power in LimboDAO is measured\n * by a points system called Fate. Staking EYE or an EYE based LP earns Fate at a quadratic rate. Fate can be used to list a proposal for voting or to vote.\n * Using Fate to make a governance decisions spens it out of existince. So Fate reflects the opportunity cost of staking.\n * Flash governance is for instant decision making that cannot wait for voting to occur. Best used for small tweaks to parameters or emergencies.\n * Flash governance requires a governance asset (EYE) be staked at the time of the execution. The asset cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time,\n * allowing for Fate holders to vote on the legitimacy of the decision. If the decision is considered malicious, the staked EYE is burnt.\n */\n///@dev Contracts subject to LimboDAO must inherit the Governable abstract contract.\ncontract LimboDAO is Ownable {\n  event daoKilled(address newOwner);\n  event proposalLodged(address proposal, address proposer);\n  event voteCast(address voter, address proposal, int256 fateCast);\n  event assetApproval(address asset, bool appoved);\n  event proposalExecuted(address proposal, bool approved);\n  event assetBurnt(address burner, address asset, uint256 fateCreated);\n\n  using TransferHelper for address;\n  uint256 constant ONE = 1 ether;\n  uint256 precision = 1e9;\n\n  struct DomainConfig {\n    address limbo;\n    address flan;\n    address eye;\n    address fate;\n    bool live;\n    address flashGoverner;\n    address sushiFactory;\n    address uniFactory;\n  }\n\n  struct ProposalConfig {\n    uint256 votingDuration;\n    uint256 requiredFateStake;\n    address proposalFactory; //check this for creating proposals\n  }\n\n  struct ProposalState {\n    int256 fate;\n    ProposalDecision decision;\n    address proposer;\n    uint256 start;\n    Proposal proposal;\n  }\n\n  //rateCrate\n  struct FateState {\n    uint256 fatePerDay;\n    uint256 fateBalance;\n    uint256 lastDamnAdjustment;\n  }\n\n  struct AssetClout {\n    uint256 fateWeight;\n    uint256 balance;\n  }\n\n  DomainConfig public domainConfig;\n  ProposalConfig public proposalConfig;\n\n  /**@notice for staking EYE, we simply take the square root of staked amount.\n   * For LP tokens, only half the value of the token is EYE so it's tempting to take the square root for the EYE balance.

It corresponds conceptually to Sushi's Masterchef and takes design inspiration from Masterchef.\nContext: Limbo is a part of the Behodler ecosystem. All dapps within the Behodler ecosystem either support or are supported by the Behodler AMM.\nPurpose: As a single contract store of liquidity, Behodler AMM requires new tokens be initiated with the a TVL equal to the average TVL of existing tokens. \n         In Behodler nomenclature, the total value of all tokens in the AMM is the total value bonded (TVB) and the value of individual tokens is the average value bonded (AVB). \n         The primary goal of Limbo is to raise capital for prospective AMM tokens in order to meet the AVB threshold. \nSecondary goals: since Limbo possesses staking mechanics, a secondary goal is to encourage lockup of protocol tokens.\nTypes of staking: Staked tokens are either for migration to Behodler or for lockup. The former pools are threshold and the latter are perpetual.\nPrimary incentive: users staking on Limbo receive the perpetually minted Flan token. \nEconomics: When the staked value of a threshold token is migrated to Behodler, SCX is generated. The SCX is used via an external AMM such as Uniswap to prop up the liquidity and value of Flan. \n           Rather than being used to purchase Flan on the open market, the generated SCX is paired with newly minted Flan in a ratio that steers the price of Flan toward parity with Dai.\n           This mechanism of pairing and steering the price through minting is known in Behodler as price tilting and effectively doubles the liquidity raised. For instance, suppose we list\n           $10000 of a new token on Behodler. We then take $10000 worth of SCX and pair it with $10000 of newly minted Flan, adding $20000 of token liquidity to an external AMM. The extra \n           $10000 will form the price support for newly minted Flan which can be used to encourage future migrations.\n           In addition to migration driven liquidity growth, Flan will be rewarded for token lockup. For lockup of Flan, the price support pressure of reduced circulating supply will provide additional \n           runway from which to mint more Flan. For external AMM pair contracts involving SCX or Pyrotokens, the lockup will raise liquidity for those pairs which will promote arbitrage trading of the pairs which will\n           lead to additional burning of those tokens. For direct lockup of SCX, additional minting of SCX corresponds algorithmically to increased liquidity on Behodler and an increased SCX price. This raises the AVB of Behodler which creates \n           additional liquidity for Flan during the next migration. Flan therefore has 4 supporting vectors: SCX from migration, price support for SCX via lockup, price support via PyroFlan and indirect price support of Flan and SCX via trading on external pairs (automining).\nNomenclature: Since words like token are incredibly generic, we need to provide context through naming. Sticking to an overall metaphor, to paraphrase MakerDao documentation, reduces code smells.\n          1. A token listed on Limbo is a Soul\n          2. When a token lists on Behodler, we say the soul is crossing over. The event is a crossing.\n          3. A token crosses over when the TVL on Limbo exceeds a threshold.\n          4. Tokens which do not cross over such as existing tokens listed on Behodler or the protocol tokens are perpetual souls.\n\nSecurity note: Since the migration steps generate value transfers between protocols, forced delays should be instituted to close any flash loan or dominant miner ttack vectors.\n\nBasic staking incentives:\nFor both perpatual and threshold souls, a flan per second statistic is divided proportionately amongst the existing stakers.\n\nLate stakers considerations:\nSuppose you're the last person to stake on a threshold soul. That is, your stake takes the soul over the crossing threshold and the soul is locked.\nIn this instance, you would have earned no Flan, creating a declining incentive for stakers to arrive and in the extreme leading\nto a situation of never crossing the threshold for any soul. This is a tragedy of the commons situation that leads to an overly \ninflated and essentially worthless Flan. We need a strategy to ameliorate this. The strategy needs to:\n1. provide sufficient incentive for later arrivals.\n2. Not punish early stakers and ideally reward them for being early.\n3. Not disproportionately inflate the supply of flan.\n\nCrossing incentives:\nAfter a crossing, stakers are no longer able to withdraw their tokens as they'll now be sent to Behodler. They'll therefore need to be compensated for loss of tokens. \nGovernance can calibrate two variables on a soul to encourage prospective stakers in threshold souls to breach the threshold:\n1. Initial crossing bonus (ICB) is the Flan per token paid to all stakers and is a positive integer.\n2. Crossing bonus delta (CBD) is the Flan per token for every second the soul is live. For instance suppose the CBD is 2. From the very first token staked to\nthe point at which the threshold was crossed, the soul records 10000 seconds passing. This amounts to 2*10000 = 20000 Flan per token.\nThe ICB and CBD are combined to forma Total Flan Per Token (TF) and the individual user balance is multiplied by TF. For instance, using the example above, suppose the ICB is 10 Flan per token.\nThis means the total Flan per token paid out is 10 + 20000 = 20010 Flan per token. If a user has 3 T staked, they receive 3*20010 = 60030 Flan as reward for having their T migrated to Behodler.\nThis is in addition to any Flan their received during the staking phase.\nNote: CBD can be negative. This creates a situation where the initial bonus per token is at its highest when the staking round begins. \nFor negative CBD, the intent is to create a sense of urgency amongst prospective stakers to push the pool over the threshold. For positive CBD, the intent is to draw marginal stakers into the soul in a desire to receive the crossing bonus while the opportunity still exists.\nA negative CBD benefits from strong communal coordination. For instance, if the token listed has a large, active and well heeled community, a negative CBD might act as a rallying cry to ape in. A positive CBD benefits from individually uncoordinated motivations (classical market setting)\nStates of migration:\n1. calibration\nNo staking/unstaking.\n2. Staking\nStaking/unstaking. If type is threshold, take threshold into account\n3. WaitingToCross\nCan claim rewards. Can't unstake.\n4. CrossedOver\nInjected into Behodler\n\nFlash governance:\nSince there might be many souls staking, we don't want to have to go through long-to-confirm proposals.\nInstead, we want to have the opportunity to flash a governance action quickly. Flash governance happens in the span of 1 transaction.\nTo protect the community and the integrity of the DAO, all flash governance decisions must be accompanied by a large EYE deposit that presumably is more costly to give up\nthan the most profitable attack vector. The deposit is locked for a duration long enough for a long form burn proposal to be voted on.\n\nThe community can then decide if their governance action was in accord with the wellbeing of Limbo.\nIf it isn't, they can slash the deposit by betwen 1 and 100%. Flash gov can only move a variable some percentage per day.\nEg. suppose we vote on snapshot to raise the threshold for Sushi to 1200 Sushi from 1180, 1.69%. Some chosen community member flash sets the threshold to the new value.\nA malicious flash staker then sets the threshold down to 1150. The community believes that the latter user was acting against the will of the community and a formal proposal is deployed onchain which slashes the user's staked EYE.\nThe community votes on the proposal and the EYE is slashed. After a fixed timeout, the EYE belonging to the original flash staker.\n\nRectangle of Fairness:\nWhen new lquidity is added to Behodler, SCX is generated. The fully undiluted price of the new quantity of SCX far exceeds the value of the tokens migrated. Because of the dynamics of Behodler's bonding curve, the \ncurrent value of the AVB is always equal to about 25 SCX. If the AVB increases, the increase shows up as in increase in the SCX price so that the 25 SCX metric still holds. For this reason, only 25 SCX is used to prop up\nthe liquidity of Flan. The surplus SCX generated is burnt. Because multiplying 25 SCX by the current market price gives us a value equal to the AVB and because we wish to strike a balance between boosting Flan and not over diluting the \nmarket with too much SCX, this value is known as the Rectangle of Fairness. While 25 SCX is the value of AVB, it's usually desirable to hold back a bit more than 25 for 2 reasons:\n1. SCX burns on transfer so that after all open market operations are complete, we'd have less than 25 remaining. \n2. CPMMs such as Uniswap impose hyperbolic price slippage so that trying to withdraw the full balance of SCX results in paying an assymptotically high Flan price. As such we can deploy a bit more than 25 SCX per migrations without worrying about added dilution \n*/\nenum SoulState {\n  calibration,\n  staking,\n  waitingToCross,\n  crossedOver\n}\nenum SoulType {\n  uninitialized,\n  threshold, //the default soul type is staked and when reaching a threshold, migrates to Behodler\n  perpetual //the type of staking pool most people are familiar with.\n}\n\n/*\nError string legend:\ntoken not recognized as valid soul.\t           E1\ninvalid state\t                                 E2\nunstaking locked\t                             E3\nbalance exceeded\t                             E4\nbonus already claimed.\t                       E5\ncrossing bonus arithmetic invariant.\t         E6\ntoken accounted for.\t                         E7\nburning excess SCX failed.\t                   E8\nInvocation reward failed.\t                     E9\nonly threshold souls can be migrated           EB\nnot enough time between crossing and migration EC\nbonus must be positive                         ED\nUnauthorized call                              EE\nProtocol disabled                              EF\nReserve divergence tolerance exceeded          EG\nnot enough time between reserve stamps         EH\nMinimum APY only applicable to threshold souls EI\nGovernance action failed.
