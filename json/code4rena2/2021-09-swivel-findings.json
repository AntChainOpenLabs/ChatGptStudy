                "Location": "onlyAdmin functions that change critical contract parameters/addresses/state",

                "Description": "Privileged functions in all contracts, for e.g. VaultTracker onlyAdmin, have direct financial or trust impact on users who should be given an opportunity to react to them by exiting/engaging without being surprised when changes initiated by such functions are made effective opaquely (without events) and/or immediately (without timelocks)",
                "Repair": "Add events to all possible flows and consider adding timelocks to such onlyAdmin functions"

                "Type": "Overwriting previously created markets",
                "Description": "The createMarket function allows accidental overwriting of previously created markets for the same combination of underlying and maturity timestamp (u, m) because there is no zero-address check to see if a previously created market exists for that combination.",
                "Repair": "Add a zero-address check for markets[u][m] in createMarket before writing to it"

                "Description": "The current implementation doesn't work with fee-on-transfer underlying tokens. This becomes particularly problematic in the following scenario: a market for USDT is running without problems, then they activate the fee: this effectively blocks users from redeeming the underlying.",
                "Repair": "Implement a way to handle these tokens. A possible way to do it is to check the balance of the contract before and after every time a token is transferred to see the effective quantity. To help keeping the code clear, a function like Compound's doTransferIn can be implemented."

                "Description": "Not every ERC20 token follows OpenZeppelin's recommendation. It's possible (inside ERC20 standard) that a transferFrom doesn't revert upon failure but returns false. The code doesn't check these return values.",

                "Description": "Taker is charged fees twice in exitVaultFillingVaultInitiate() . Maker is transferring less than premiumFilled to taker and then taker is expected to pay fees i.e. taker's net balance is premiumFilled 2*fee",
                "Repair": "Charge fees only once to the maker instead of charging the taker twice"

                "Type": "Incorrect Implementation",
                "Description": "The implementation of initiateZcTokenFillingZcTokenExit() function is incorrect as it transfers premium paid to maker and fee to Swivel together, which is not the intended behavior.",
                "Repair": "Change the transfer logic to transfer premium to maker and fee to Swivel separately"

                "Description": "Admin role has absolute power across Swivel, Marketplace and VaultTracker contracts with no ability to change admin to a new address or renounce it, making it a single-point of failure.",
                "Repair": "Make admins reasonably redundant/independent (3/7 or 5/9) multisigs and add transfer/renounce functionality for admin. Consider using OpenZeppelin\u2019s Ownable library."
