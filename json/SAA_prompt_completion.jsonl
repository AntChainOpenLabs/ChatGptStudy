During the transfer process, the malicious removal of the last 0 bytes of data from the recipient's address allows EVM to automatically complete it. The attack process is as follows:\nCall the first 4 bytes of the function: a9059cbb\nTransfer address: 0000000000 000000 15022eCbc4Fc993d1Fd179A41F7b985fA9C0b700\nTransfer amount: 0000000000\nIf the last byte 0 of the transfer address is maliciously removed, the data is as follows:\nCall the first 4 bytes of the function: a9059cbb\nTransfer address: 0000000000 000000 15022eCbc4Fc993d1Fd179A41F7b985fA9C0b7\nTransfer amount: 0000000000\nParsing data into EVM for data restoration:\nCall the first 4 bytes of the function: a9059cbb\nTransfer address 32 bytes: 0000000000 000000 15022eCbc4Fc993d1Fd179A41F7b985fA9C0b700\nTransfer amount of 32 bytes: 0000000000\nEVM will analyze the data according to the rules. As mentioned above, you will find that the last two digits of the transfer address are replaced by the transfer amount. So what should be done if the transfer amount is one byte less?\nThere is an automatic completion mechanism in EVM, which fills in 0 for all bytes that are missing. The transfer amount after filling in j is as follows:\nTransfer amount 32 bytes: 0000000000\nDid you find anything here? Originally, only 1 TOEKN was transferred, but after the attack, 256 TOKENs were transferred, which is the original cause of the short address attackThe vulnerability locates at:  function transfer###"}
