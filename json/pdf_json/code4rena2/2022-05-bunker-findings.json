                "Description": "The safeTransferFrom function in CNft.sol deviates from the expected behavior of the ERC1155 standard interface, which can break composability and standard behavior.",

                "Repair": "Comment all behavior associated with token distributions if token distributions are not meant to be supported, or uncomment all occurrences of the updateCompSupplyIndex() and distributeSupplierComp() functions"

                "Description": "The use of the deprecated transfer() function in CEther.sol can cause transactions to fail if the claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function, implements a payable fallback that uses more than 2300 gas units, or implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.",
                "Repair": "Use call() instead of transfer(), implement CEI patterns in CEther, and add a global state lock on the comptroller"
