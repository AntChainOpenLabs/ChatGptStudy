Therefore, old (and not updated) pools will lose it's share during the next update.<br\nTherefore, user rewards are not computed correctly (will be always smaller).\n\n\nScenario 1:\n\n1.  Owner adds new pool (first pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalPoints=100)<br\n    and 1 block later Alice stakes 10 tokens in the first pool.\n2.  1 week passes\n3.  Alice withdraws her 10 tokens and claims X amount of reward tokens.<br\n    and 1 block later Bob stakes 10 tokens in the first pool.\n4.  1 week passes\n5.  Owner adds new pool (second pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalPoints=200)<br\n    and 1 block later Bob withdraws his 10 tokens and claims X/2 amount of reward tokens.<br\n    But he should get X amount\n\nScenario 2:\n\n1.

Right after that, when Alice, Bob or Charlie wants to withdraw tokens and claim rewards they will only be able to claim 20% of what they should be eligible for, because their pool is updated with 20% (100/500) rewards instead of 100% (100/100) rewards for the past week.\n\n",

                "Description": "\nThe ConvexStakingWrapper.sol implementation makes several modifications to the original design. One of the key changes is the ability to add multiple pools into the wrapper contract, where each pool is represented by a unique _pid. By doing this, we are able to aggregate pools and their LP tokens to simplify the token distribution process.\n\nHowever, the interdependence between pools introduces new problems. Because the original implementation uses the contract's reward token balance to track newly claimed tokens, it is possible for a malicious user to abuse the unguarded getReward function to maximise the profit they are able to generate. By calling getReward on multiple pools with the same reward token (i.e. cvx), users are able to siphon rewards from other pools. This inevitably leads to certain loss of rewards for users who have deposited LP tokens into these victim pools. As crv and cvx are reward tokens by default, it is very likely that someone will want to exploit this issue.\n\n\nLet's consider the following scenario:\n\n*   There are two convex pools with _pid 0 and 1.\n*   Both pools currently only distribute cvx tokens.\n*   Alice deposits LP tokens into the pool with _pid 0.\n*   Both pools earn 100 cvx tokens which are to be distributed to the holders of the two pools.\n*   While Alice is a sole staker of the pool with _pid 0, the pool with _pid 1 has several stakers.\n*   Alice decides she wants to maximise her potential rewards, so she directly calls the unguarded IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).getReward function on both pools, resulting in 200 cvx tokens being sent to the contract.\n*   She then decides to deposit the 0 amount to execute the _calcRewardIntegral function on the pool with _pid 0. However, this function will calculate d_reward as bal reward.remaining which is effectively the change in contract balance. As we have directly claimed cvx tokens over the two pools, this d_reward will be equal to 200.\n*   Alice is then entitled to the entire 200 tokens as she is the sole staker of her pool. So instead of receiving 100 tokens, she is able to siphon rewards from other pools.\n\nAltogether, this will lead to the loss of rewards for other stakers as they are unable to then claim their rewards.\n\nConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L216-L259(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L216-L259)\n\n    function _calcRewardIntegral(\n        uint256 _pid,\n        uint256 _index,\n        address _account,\n        uint256 _balance,\n        uint256 _supply\n    ) internal {\n        RewardType memory reward = rewards[_pid][_index];\n\n        //get difference in balance and remaining rewards\n        //getReward is unguarded so we use remaining to keep track of how much was actually claimed\n        uint256 bal = IERC20(reward.token).balanceOf(address(this));\n        uint256 d_reward = bal reward.remaining;\n        // send 20 % of cvx / crv reward to treasury\n        if (reward.token == cvx || reward.token == crv) {\n            IERC20(reward.token).transfer(treasury, d_reward / 5);\n            d_reward = (d_reward * 4) / 5;\n        }\n        IERC20(reward.token).transfer(address(claimContract), d_reward);\n\n        if (_supply  0 && d_reward  0) {\n            reward.integral =\n                reward.integral +\n                uint128((d_reward * 1e20) / _supply);\n        }\n\n        //update user integrals\n        uint256 userI = userReward[_pid][_index][_account].integral;\n        if (userI < reward.integral) {\n            userReward[_pid][_index][_account].integral = reward.integral;\n            claimContract.pushReward(\n                _account,\n                reward.token,\n                (_balance * (reward.integral userI)) / 1e20\n            );\n        }\n\n        //update remaining reward here since balance could have changed if claiming\n        if (bal != reward.remaining) {\n            reward.remaining = uint128(bal);\n        }\n\n        rewards[_pid][_index] = reward;\n    }\n\n\nManual code review.<br\nConfirmation from Taek.\n\n",

The withdraw function allows callers to withdraw tokens based on the tokens they have deposited into the shelter client: ConvexStakingWrapper. However, withdraw does not check if a user has already withdrawn their tokens. Thus a user that can withdraw tokens, can call withdraw repeatedly to steal the tokens of others.\n\n\ntl;dr an attacker that can successfully call withdraw once on a shelter, can call it repeatedly to steal the funds of others. Below is a detailed scenario where this situation can be exploited.\n\n1.  Mallory deposits 1 wETH into ConvexStakingWrapper using deposit(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L280). Let's also assume that other users have deposited 2 wETH into the same contract.\n2.  An emergency happens and the owner of ConvexStakingWrapper calls setShelter(shelter) and enterShelter([pidOfWETHToken, ...]). Now shelter has 3 wETH and is activated for wETH.\n3.  Mallory calls shelter.withdraw(wETHAddr, MalloryAddr), Mallory will rightfully receive 1 wETH because her share of wETH in the shelter is 1/3.\n4.  Mallory calls shelter.withdraw(wETHAddr, MalloryAddr) again, receiving 1/3*2 = 2/3 wETH. withdraw does not check that she has already withdrawn. This time, the wETH does not belong to her, she has stolen the wETH of the other users. She can continue calling withdraw to steal the rest of the funds\n\n",
                "Repair": "\nTo mitigate this, withdraw must first check that msg.sender has not withdrawn this token before and withdraw must also record that msg.sender has withdrawn the token.\nThe exact steps for this are below:\n\n1.  Add the following line to the beginning of withdraw (line 53):\n\n<!----\n\n    require(!claimed[_token][msg.sender], \"already claimed\")\n\n2.  Replace line 55(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/Shelter.sol#L55) with the following:\n\n<!----\n\n    claimed[_token][msg.sender] = true;\n\nThis replacement is necessary because we want to record who is withdrawing, not where they are sending the token which isn't really useful info.\n\nryuheimat (Concur) confirmed(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/246)\n\nAlex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented(https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/246#issuecomment-1092877228):\n  The warden has identified a logical fallacy in the Shelter contract.\n \n This would allow a caller to claim their tokens multiple times, as long as they send them to a new address.\n \n Mitigation is as simple as checking claims against msg.sender, however because all funds can be drained, this finding is of High Severity.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n"

The other 10 CRV got left in the contract which can be frozen in the contract, see below for the details:\n\n5.
